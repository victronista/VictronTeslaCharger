This is a prototype of Nodered app for managing Tesla charging without smart wallbox.
it runs on Cerbo GX, and connects to your Tesla to start and stop charging and set the charging amps based on your actual solar power considering other consumption in the house.

The solution is developed for my home FVE that consists of 3-phase system with 3x Multiplus II 3000 in ESS mode, and 4 MPPTs.
The first version uses Tessie API. and you need to get an auth token via https://dash.tessie.com/settings/api. You generate token there and then use it in the flow.

1. You need to enter your access token to the fist flow, so its gets loaded to global variable.
2. The Victron controls for need to be updated you yours, and the code in the fuctions need to be updated to refer your controls (names of MPPTs) and you need to also adjust the code to reflect your number of contreols in the join function. And more. Its jsut example.
